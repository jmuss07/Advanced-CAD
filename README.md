## The_Skateboard

### Description
This assignment was to make a skateboard in Onshape! To start, I built up a deck, and made the trucks based off of that. From there, I built axels and wheels, and used mate connectors in an Onshape Assembly to put it all together!

### Reflection
The majority of this assignment used skills that I had learned and practiced in Onshape in previous classes. However, the instructions that went along with the assignment showed new strategies and tools that can be used in part studios. For instance, in order to create the iconic angled ends of the skateboard, I used the tool "Move Face", a tool whioch I had never heard of or used before! It's a fairly simple tool to use, you just select a closed off shape/face of a part, and you can choose the "rotate" setting, which, when changing the angle, changes the bend in a part! For the assembly, I used only "Fastened" mate connectors, which I *had* used before.

## How_The_Pros_Do_It

### Description
This assignment was to make a simple 2x4 lego in Onshape. It was later made more complicated in the assignment "One Brick to Rule Them All", which is featured later in this repository!

### Reflection 
This one went fairly smoothly! Aside from the usual sketch and extrude tools, the lego used the "Shell" and "Linear Pattern" tools. It was also a great introduction to variables in Onshape, something that I hadn't used before. Variables allow you to have a changeable value for things like side length and angle values in Onshape(A variable that's been created starts with a hashtag(#)). In this assignment, three variables were created, with one controlling the height of the brick (represented by "#height"), one controlling the number of rows on the brick(represented by "#rows"), and the other representing the number of columns(Represented by "#cols"). This feature was utilised to create the bumps on the top of the brick, and was used again to create the connector pieces at the bottom of the lego! For the bottom to have the proper number of connector pieces inside the shell (on an actual lego, it has one less connector row than the bumps on the top, and one less connector column than the number of columns on the top), I made a linear pattern with the number of horizontal repeats listed as "#rows-1" and the number of vertical repeats listed as "#cols-1." I'm glad that I learned to use this feature, since it seems like it will be extremely helpful in the future.

## One_Brick_To_Rule_Them_All

### Description
In this assignment, we built up on what we had made in the previous assignment. We used configurations on our legos from the previous assignment in ordedr to have just one brick that can be changed into many different bricks in the assembly!

### Reflection
This was a trickier assignment. I had never used configurations before, so I read through the assignment page's description of them before starting. Essentially, configurations allow you to make multiple versions of the same part in one part studio that you can switch between easily, and are super helpful for making parts that are relatively uniform with smaller ddifferences.There's a whole section in an Onshape parts studio that allows you to see and create new configurations! In order to make configurations, you simply need to open the Configurations tab in your parts studio, and select the different values that you want to control with your configurations. From there, you can simply change the value in you configurations table, and volila! You can now easily shift through different versions of the same part without a bunch of different sketches and part studios! When making configurations, variables come in handy so that you can change just one value, and the rest of the related values will change along with it, so that you don't have to click through and create configurations for every related value!

## The_Multi-Tool

### Description
This assignment was to make a multii-tool (one tool containing multiple other tools) in Onshape! This multitool contains a wrench, a protractor, a square, and a ruler for both centimeters and inches!

### Reflection 
This project also went pretty well! Aside from the usual sketch and extrude tools, the multi-tool made use of multiple construction lines and patterns. It was mostly confined to two sketches, with one sketch serving as the base shape for the tool. To get the curve of the protractor, I used the 3-point arc tool. For the holes, I used a linear pattern. I originally tried to model one hole in a new sketch, extrude-remove it, and then make a linear part pattern of it for the other holes, but that was unsuccesful. Instead of just patterning the hole like I wanted, it patterned the whole multitool. I went back to the sketch with every intention to just create and distance the other holes by hand. As I was about to start this process, I saw the linear pattern tool within the sketch. The in-sketch version of this tool patterns just specific features, all confined to the specific sketch. I gave this tool a shot in the sketch with the original hole. It was extremely successful, and I was then able to just extrude-remove all the holes at once. This worked wonderfully for the inch and centimeter marker holes. For the degree holes for the protractor holes, though, this method didn't work. Instead, I measured out three construction lines from the corner of the multi-tool. Each line was a certain number of degrees that would be needed for a protractor (In this case, I used 30°, 45°, and 60°), and centered each circle on the proper line, using the dimension tool to get the proper size and spacing from the edge.The final challenge came from adding the wrench. In order to get it the right size (the same as a hex-nut), I added a nut of the right size to the assembly along with the multi-tool to an assemble. After mating the nut to the multi-tool and aligning it to where I wanted it, I was able to use the "edit in context" tool. This tool brings you back to the sketch, and shows the transparent version of the selected objects in your assembly. Using this feature, I was able to use the "use geometry" tool to copy the dimensions and location of the hex nut to my multi-tool sketch. From there I extrude-removed, and converted my document to a sketch, exported the file, and laser cut it.
